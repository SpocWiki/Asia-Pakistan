## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Badshahi Mosque (Punjabi: شاہی مسیت, romanized: śāhī masīt; Urdu: بادشاہی مسجد, 
> romanized: bādśāhī masjid) is a Mughal-era imperial mosque located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. 
> 
> It was constructed between 1671 and 1673 during the rule of Aurangzeb, 
> opposite of the Lahore Fort on the northern outskirts of the historic Walled City. 
> It is widely considered to be one of the most iconic landmarks of Pakistan.
>
> The Badshahi Mosque was built between 1671 and 1673 by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. 
> The mosque is an important example of Mughal architecture, 
> with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. 
> 
> It remains the largest mosque of the Mughal-era, and is the third-largest mosque in Pakistan. 
> In 1799, during the rule of Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire, 
> the mosque's courtyard was used as a stable and its hujras (cells) as soldiers quarters. 
> 
> When the British Empire took control of Lahore in 1846 it was used as a garrison until 1852. 
> Subsequently, the Badshahi Mosque Authority was established 
> to oversee its restoration as a place of worship. 
> It is now one of Pakistan's most iconic sights.
